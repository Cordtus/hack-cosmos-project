## Primary Use Cases

### 1. **Governance Proposal Management**

#### Problem Statement
Creating governance proposals through CLI requires:
- Manual JSON file construction
- Understanding of complex message structures
- Risk of syntax errors causing transaction failures
- Difficulty tracking proposal status
- No guidance on parameter implications

#### Chain Orchestrator Solution
- **Visual Proposal Wizard**: Step-by-step guided workflow for all 18+ proposal types
- **Smart Auto-Generation**: Automatically generates titles and summaries from parameter selections
- **Parameter Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Preview & Review**: See exactly what will be submitted before broadcasting
- **One-Click Submission**: Submit proposals directly from the interface
- **Auto-Vote Feature**: Optionally auto-vote YES immediately after submission

#### Example: Parameter Change Proposal
**Traditional CLI Approach:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create JSON file manually
cat > proposal.json <<EOF
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "@type": "/evmos.evm.vm.v1.MsgUpdateParams",
      "authority": "evmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6z...",
      "params": {
        "evm_denom": "aevmos",
        "enable_create": true,
        "enable_call": true,
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": "",
  "deposit": [{"amount": "10000000", "denom": "aevmos"}],
  "title": "Update VM Parameters",
  "summary": "This proposal updates...",
  "expedited": false
}
EOF

# Step 2: Submit (hoping JSON is valid)
evmosd tx gov submit-proposal proposal.json \
  --from=validator \
  --chain-id=evmos_9001-2 \
  --gas=auto \
  --fees=1000aevmos

# Step 3: Query for proposal ID
evmosd query gov proposals --reverse --limit=1

# Step 4: Vote on proposal
evmosd tx gov vote 123 yes --from=validator
```

**Chain Orchestrator Approach:**
1. Select "Parameter Change" from dropdown
2. Choose parameters to update with visual selectors
3. Review auto-generated title and summary (editable)
4. Enable "Auto-vote Yes" toggle
5. Click "Submit Proposal & Vote Yes"

**Time Savings: 15-20 minutes â†’ 2-3 minutes**

### 3. **Multi-Module Configuration Management**

#### Problem Statement
Updating parameters across multiple modules requires:
- Creating separate MsgUpdateParams for each module
- Understanding module-specific parameter schemas
- Ensuring consistency across related parameters
- Manual validation of parameter values

#### Chain Orchestrator Solution
- **Unified Parameter View**: Browse all module parameters in one place
- **Multi-Selection**: Update parameters across VM, ERC20, and Feemarket modules simultaneously
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Automatically groups parameters by module
- **Default Values**: Shows current defaults for reference
- **Type-Safe Inputs**: Custom UI components for each parameter type (switches, arrays, objects)

#### Example Workflow
1. Open Parameter Selector accordion
2. Check boxes next to desired parameters across multiple modules
3. Configure each parameter with type-appropriate UI controls
4. System auto-generates one proposal with multiple messages
5. Submit with a single transaction

### 4. **EVM Governance Operations**

#### Problem Statement
EVMD-specific governance operations are complex:
- Registering preinstalled contracts requires hex bytecode
- ERC20 token registration needs careful address validation
- Toggle conversion affects cross-module functionality
- High risk of errors with manual configuration

#### Chain Orchestrator Solution
- **Preinstall Manager**: Upload and register contracts with validation
- **ERC20 Registry**: Batch register multiple tokens with address validation
- **Conversion Toggle**: Simple on/off for token conversion with impact warnings
- **Safety Checks**: Validates addresses, bytecode, and configuration before submission
